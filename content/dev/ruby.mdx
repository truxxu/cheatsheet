Ruby language is installed using `rbenv` to allow changing versions according
to the development environment.

```
# Cleanup existing versions
rvm implode && sudo rm -rf ~/.rvm
# If you got "zsh: command not found: rvm", carry on. It means `rvm` is not
# on your computer, that's what we want!

rm -rf ~/.rbenv

sudo apt install -y build-essential tklib zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libreadline-dev
sudo apt clean
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build

# Close the terminal and open it again

rbenv install 2.6.6 # change to most recent version!

# Make the installed version global
rbenv global 2.6.6

# Restart the terminal and check installation
ruby -v
```
