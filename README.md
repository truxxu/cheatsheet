# Cheatsheet by truxxu

This is a collection of guides and code snippets that I find useful when setting up
new machines and/or work environments. After going all over again so many times,
it was time to reunite those notes in a single place. This site is built using a
great starter built by [codebushi](https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-theme-document).
